<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
This page is intended to provide relevant information on the use and
function of the different features of the GAWA database.</p> 

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gaz24pJiK4j_Thre1CjF4najdvaqCi5ypAMHpO71pv4/viewform?embedded=true" width="760" height="522" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe>

<h2><a name="quickstart">Getting Started</a></h2>

<p>GAWA provides several main features: 

<ul>
<li> There are a number of pre-built common tasks present on a
persistent sidebar to quickly navigate to commonly used features.

<li> There is a data browsing function, so the full scope of the
database can be seen and navigated by the user.  

<li> There is the ability to download collections of images,
animations of images, and post-processor data.  These data are
assembled on the fly for further analysis.


</ul>

<h2><a name="quick_search">Quick Search</a></h2>

<p>Quick searches are a dropdown list of common queries where <i>one</i> parameter in the search query is a user-entered string. 

<p><b>Example:</b> This will return a result of Experiments that were noted
to have contained Inner Hair Cell/Sterocilia: <br/><img

<p>The search results will resemble the following example Experiment:<br/>

<p> Clicking on a focal level and a frequency will return a link to an image group:

<p>Finally, links are availble to download the list of files returned, the animated collection, and the full-resolution images.

<h2><a name="quick_queries">Quick Queries</a></h2>

<p>Quick queries are selectable from a drop-down menu.  These are all queries with no configurable parameters.
<br/><img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/quickquery_1.png"/>

<p>
<ul>
<li><h4>All Experiments</h4>

<p>This option returns a list of every experiment currently recorded
in the database, with relevant metadata.  Clicking on a given
experiment list item brings up that experiment's full page.
<p><img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/quickquery_allexperiments.png"/>

<li><h4>Experiments without a Tonotopic Location</h4>

<p>This option returns a list of every experiment for which a Tonotopic Location has yet to be assigned.
<p><img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/quickquery_tonoexperiments.png"/>

<li><h4>Experiments without a Region of Interest</h4>

<p>This option returns a list of Experiments for which no Region of Interest post analysis has yet been performed.

<p><img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/quickquery_roiexperiments.png"/>

<li><h4>Remarks by Experiment and Focal Plane</h4>

<p> This option returns a list of Image Groups and their focal planes and remarks.

<p>
<img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/quickquery_imageremarks.png"/>

<li><h4>Images without ROI</h4>

<p>This option returns a list of Image Groups on which no Region of Interest post analysis has been performed.

</ul>


<h2><a name="semi_quick_queries">Semi-Quick Queries</a></h2>

<p>Semi-quick queries allow keyword searches on different parameters, predicated on different prior criteria.

<ul>
<li><h4>Tonotopic Map</h4><br/>
<img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/semiquick_tono.png"/>
<p>This query returns a list of all images for a particular tonotopic region.

<p><img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/semiquick_tono_result.png"/>

<li><h4>Image Frequency</h4><br/>
<img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/semiquick_freq.png"/>

<p>This query returns a list of all images of a given frequency whose remarks note a particular physiological structure of interest.

<p><img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/semiquick_freq_result.png"/>


<li><h4>Minimum Levels</h4><br/>
<img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/semiquick_level.png"/>

<p>This query returns a list of all experiments that include at least the specified number of focal plane levels. 

<p><img src="http://bioed.bu.edu/students_13/gawa/images/semiquick_level_result.png"/>


</ul>
<h2><a name="browse">Browse</a></h2>

<p>The browse function allows the user to explore the full contents of
the database, ultimately arriving at an Image Group where the
individual images can be previewed and downloaded.  The Browse icon is located in the main toobar. 

<p><h4>Refining Results</h4>

<p>For each browsing category, the sidebar is populated with:
<ol>
<li>An array of checkboxes that control the display of corresponding columns in the list view.
<li>An array of dropdown boxes that can be used to narrow search results to only those which match the selected parameter.
</ol>

<ul>
<li><h4>Browse by Animal</h4>
A list of animals is displayed.  Clicking on each animal in the list loads a detail page that shows metadata and all Experiments associated with that Animal, which can then be selected individually. 

<li><h4>Browse by Experiment</h4>
A list of Experiments is displayed.  Clicking on each Experiment loads a detail page that shows Experiment metadata and a list of all focal planes and frequencies.  Clicking on one focal plane and one frequency will display that Image Group.

<li><h4>Browse by Image</h4>
A list of every Image is displayed.  Clicking on each Image loads that Image Group's detail page. 
</ul>


 <h2><a name="update">Update</a></h2>

 <p>Users with update rights will be able to update comment and
 quality assessment metadata for Experiments.  Logging in to the
 database through the persistent login field at the top right of the
 page will expose context-sensitive update abilities on relevant
 pages.
