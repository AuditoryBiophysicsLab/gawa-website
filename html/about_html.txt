<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p> In the mammalian auditory system, the cochlea transforms sound, a
  pressure wave in a medium, into a series of action potentials on the
  auditory nerve that are ultimately processed in cortex.  The precise
  mechanisms by which this is accomplished continue to be a matter of
  great research interest.  Airborne sound pressure waves are first
  modulated and amplified in the middle ear. The resulting signal
  propagates in the fluid-filled cochlea, and interacts with the basilar
  membrane (BM) and the Organ of Corti to result in action potentials
  propagating to the auditory nerve (AN). </p>
<p> The mechanical properties, structure, and response of the BM are the
  focus of a series of experiments on gerbils done in the Auditory
  Biophysics and Simulation Lab, in the College of Engineering's Hearing
  Research Center.  A mechanical transducer was used to actuate the BM
  at frequencies inside its physiological range, and stroboscopic images
  were taken during stimulation at a variety of focal depths. </p>
<p> Stroboscopic images were automatically recorded from a camera,
  attached to a microscope observing the experiment.  The camera is
  controlled with a National Instruments Data Acquisition card, a C#
  application, and a collection of MATLAB scripts.  Computer automation
  of data collection has resulted in large amounts of data. The bulk
  of the data are images captured from the stroboscopic microscope and
  waveform data of stimuli and responses, with associated metadata. To
  date, on the order of 100,000 images and waveforms have been stored on
  a network drive, totaling in excess of 2 terabytes of data stored on a
  12 TB Network-attached Storage (NAS) device. </p>
<p> Approximately 300 animal experiments were performed during the period
  December 2009 - July 2012, and a relevant subset of them were
  determined to be of further research value and were included in the database. </p>
<p> This project created a database to allow the researchers involved with
  the project to more efficiently sort and qualify prerecorded data for
  generation of graphics and interpretation of results.
  Additionally,this provided a mechanism for guests and interested
  members of the research community to access results for their own
  analyses. </p>
